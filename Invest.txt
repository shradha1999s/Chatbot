What is an investment:
An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation
- Appreciation refers to an increase in the value of an asset over time
- When an individual purchases a good as an investment, the intent is not to consume the good but rather to use it in the future to create wealth
- An investment always concerns the outlay of some asset today—time, money, or effort—in hopes of a greater payoff in the future than what was originally put in
For example, an investor may purchase a monetary asset now with the idea that the asset will provide income in the future or will later be sold at a higher price for a profit

Importance of investments:
Investments are important because in today’s world, just earning money is not enough You work hard for the money you earn
- But that may not be adequate for you to lead a comfortable lifestyle or fulfill your dreams and goals
- To do that, you need to make your money work hard for you as well, This is why you invest
- Money lying idle in your bank account is an opportunity lost, You should invest that money smartly to get good returns out of it

factors influencing investments:
* Age - Typically, younger investors have fewer responsibilities and a longer time horizon, When you have a long working life in front of you, you can invest in vehicles with a long-term view and also keep increasing your investment amount with an increase in your income This is why equity-oriented investments like equity mutual funds would be a better option for young investors, as compared to something like fixed deposits But on the other hand, older investors can opt for safer avenues like FDs

* Goal - Investment goals can be either short-term or long-term, For a short-term goal, you should opt for a safer investment and use the return-generating potential of equities for long-term goals Goals can also be negotiable and non-negotiable For non-negotiable goals like children’s education or down payment for a house, guaranteed-return investments would be a good choice But if the goal is negotiable, which means that it can be pushed back by a few months, then investing in equity mutual funds or stocks can be beneficial Plus, if these investments do really well, then you can even meet the goal before time

* Profile - Another thing to think about when choosing an investment option is your own profile, Factors like how much you are earning and how many financial dependants you have are also critical A young investor with a lot of time on hand may not be able to take equity-related risks if he also has the responsibility to take care of his family Similarly, someone older with no dependents and a steady source of income can choose to invest in equities to earn higher returns
This is why it is said that when it comes to investments, one size doesn’t fit all, Investments not only have to be chosen carefully but also planned properly to get the most out of them

How should I plan my investments:
The first step in planning your investments is to figure out the right investment that fits your profile and needs, Here are a few things to keep in mind when planning your investments
* Choose investments carefully after doing adequate research

* Consider the tax implications on returns you earn from your investments
* Keep things simple and avoid complicated investments that you don’t understand

types of investments:                                                                                                                                  
There are four main investment types, or asset classes, that you can choose from, each with distinct characteristics, risks and benefits,
Once you are familiar with the different types of assets you can begin to think about piecing together a mix that would fit with your personal circumstances and risk tolerance

* Growth investments - 
These are more suitable for long term investors that are willing and able to withstand market ups and downs
 
* Shares - 
Shares are considered a growth investment as they can help grow the value of your original investment over the medium to long term
If you own shares, you may also receive income from dividends, which are effectively a portion of a company’s profit paid out to its shareholders
Of course, the value of shares may also fall below the price you pay for them Prices can be volatile from day to day and shares are generally best suited to long term investors, who are comfortable withstanding these ups and downs
Also known as equities, shares have historically delivered higher returns than other assets, shares are considered one of the riskiest types of investment
 
* Property - 
Property is also considered as a growth investment because the price of houses and other properties can rise substantially over a medium to long term period
However, just like shares, property can also fall in value and carries the risk of losses
It is possible to invest directly by buying a property but also indirectly, through a property investment fund
 
* Defensive investments - 
These are more focused on consistently generating income, rather than growth, and are considered lower risk than growth investments
 
* Cash -
Cash investments include everyday bank accounts, high interest savings accounts and term deposits
They typically carry the lowest potential returns of all the investment types
While they offer no chance of capital growth, they can deliver regular income and can play an important role in protecting wealth and reducing risk in an investment portfolio
 
* Fixed interest - 
The best known type of fixed interest investments are bonds, which are essentially when governments or companies borrow money from investors and pay them a rate of interest in return

Bonds are also considered as a defensive investment, because they generally offer lower potential returns and lower levels of risk than shares or property,
They can also be sold relatively quickly, like cash, although it’s important to note that they are not without the risk of capital losses

Mutual funds have been around for the past few decades but they have gained popularity only in the last few years
- These are investment vehicles that pool the money of many investors and invest it in a way to earn optimum returns
- Different types of mutual funds invest in different securities. Equity mutual funds invest primarily in stocks and equity-related instruments, while debt mutual funds invest in bonds and papers
- There are also hybrid mutual funds that invest in equity as well as debt
- Mutual funds are flexible investment vehicles, in which you can begin and stop investing as per your convenience, Apart from tax-saving mutual funds, you can redeem investments from mutual funds any time as well
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.




Fixed deposits are investment vehicles that are for a specific, pre-defined time period
- They offer complete capital protection as well as guaranteed returns
- They are ideal for conservative investors who stay away from risks. Fixed deposits are offered by banks and for different time periods
- Fixed deposit interest rates change as per economic conditions and are decided by the banks themselves
- Fixed deposits are typically locked-in investments, but investors are often allowed to avail loans or overdraft facilities against them
- There is also a tax-saving variant of fixed deposit, which comes with a lock-in of 5 years
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.




A recurring deposit (RD) is another fixed tenure investment that allows investors to put in a specific amount every month for a pre-defined period of time
- RDs are offered by banks and post offices
- The interest rates are defined by the institution offering it
- An RD allows the investor to invest a small amount every month to build a corpus over a defined time period
- RDs offer capital protection as well as guaranteed returns
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.





The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a long-term tax-saving investment vehicle that comes with a lock-in period of 15 years
- Investments made in PPF can be used to earn a tax break, The PPF rate is decided by the Government of India every quarter
- The corpus withdrawn at the end of the 15-year period is completely tax-free in the hands of the investor
- PPF also allows loans and partial withdrawals after certain conditions have been met
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.





The Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is another retirement-oriented investment vehicle that earns a tax break under Section 80C
- EPF deductions are typically a part of an earner’s monthly salary and the same amount is matched by the employer as well
- Upon maturity, the withdrawn corpus from EPF is also entirely tax-free
- EPF rates are also decided by the Government of India every quarter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.





The National Pension System (NPS) is a relatively new tax-saving investment option
- Investors in the NPS stay locked-in till retirement and can earn higher returns than PPF or EPF since the NPS offers plan options that invest in equities as well
- The maturity corpus from the NPS is not entirely tax-free and a part of it has to be used to purchase an annuity that will give the investor a regular pension
